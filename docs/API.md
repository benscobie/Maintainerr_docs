# Maintainerr API docs

!!! danger
  The API, and all of Maintainerr for that matter, does not have any authentication methods. There are certain API calls, that if you make your instance public facing, will expose your entire settings configuration. This could include all of your service's API keys. Proceed with extreme caution if you choose to expose Maintainerr to the public.
